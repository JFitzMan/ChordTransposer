Chord Transposer
==============

This java static class contains the method trans(String chord, int amount)

- Chord is the original chord that needs to be transposed
- Amount is the amount of half steps it needs to be moved. This can be a positive or negative number.

The test file comes with a bunch of JUnit tests to ensure the transposer is working properly.
